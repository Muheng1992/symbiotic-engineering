# Fix — Smart Problem Resolution

Analyze problems, identify root causes, and orchestrate the right agents to resolve them. This skill acts as a diagnostic triage system.

## Usage

```
/fix [error message, bug description, or issue reference]
```

## Phase 1: Problem Intake

Gather all available information about the problem:

1. **Error Message**: Capture the full error output (stack trace, error code, message)
2. **Context**: When does it occur? (build, test, runtime, deployment)
3. **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce, or conditions that trigger the issue
4. **Scope**: Which files, modules, or layers are involved?
5. **Recent Changes**: Check `git log --oneline -10` and `git diff` for recent modifications

## Phase 2: Diagnosis

Classify the problem and identify root cause:

### Problem Classification

| Category | Indicators | Primary Agent |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Build Error** | Compilation failure, import errors, missing deps | `implementer` |
| **Test Failure** | Assertion errors, test timeout, coverage drop | `tester` |
| **Runtime Bug** | Unexpected behavior, crash, wrong output | `implementer` |
| **Security Issue** | Vulnerability report, OWASP finding, auth bypass | `security-auditor` → `implementer` |
| **Architecture Violation** | Layer dependency violation, circular import | `architect` → `implementer` |
| **Performance Issue** | Slow queries, memory leak, high latency | `architect` → `implementer` |
| **Integration Failure** | API mismatch, data format error, connection refused | `integrator` → `implementer` |
| **Documentation Gap** | Missing/outdated docs, wrong API description | `documenter` |

### Root Cause Analysis

Use the **5 Whys** technique:
1. **Why** did the error occur? → Direct cause
2. **Why** did that happen? → Contributing factor
3. **Why** was that possible? → Systemic issue
4. **Why** wasn't it caught? → Testing/review gap
5. **Why** wasn't it prevented? → Process/design gap

### Diagnostic Commands

Run these as appropriate:
```bash
# Build errors
npm run build 2>&1 | tail -50
# or: cargo build 2>&1, go build ./..., etc.

# Test failures
npm test 2>&1 | tail -100
# Look for: FAIL, Error, AssertionError

# Dependency issues
npm ls --depth=0 2>&1 | grep -i "err\|missing\|invalid"

# Recent changes that might have caused the issue
git log --oneline -10
git diff HEAD~3 --stat
```

## Phase 3: Resolution Strategy

Based on the diagnosis, create a resolution plan:

### Single-Agent Fix
For straightforward problems with clear root cause:
1. Identify the exact file(s) and line(s) to change
2. Spawn the appropriate agent with precise instructions
3. Verify the fix resolves the problem

### Multi-Agent Fix
For complex problems spanning multiple concerns:
1. Spawn `architect` to analyze impact and design fix approach
2. Spawn `implementer` to apply the code changes
3. Spawn `tester` to verify fix and add regression tests
4. Spawn `reviewer` to check the fix quality
5. Spawn `security-auditor` if the fix touches security-sensitive code

### Fix Priority Matrix

| Severity | Impact | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | System down, data loss, security breach | Fix immediately, skip ceremony |
| **HIGH** | Feature broken, tests failing, build broken | Fix before any new work |
| **MEDIUM** | Degraded performance, edge case bug | Schedule in current sprint |
| **LOW** | Cosmetic, minor inconvenience | Add to backlog |

## Phase 4: Fix Execution

### Pre-Fix Checklist
- [ ] Root cause identified and documented
- [ ] Fix approach determined
- [ ] Affected files listed
- [ ] Regression risk assessed

### Fix Process
1. **Create a regression test** that reproduces the bug (RED — it should fail)
2. **Apply the fix** (GREEN — test should pass)
3. **Run full test suite** to check for regressions
4. **Review** the fix for quality and completeness

### Post-Fix Verification
- [ ] Original error no longer occurs
- [ ] Regression test passes
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] No new warnings or issues introduced
- [ ] Fix follows Clean Architecture rules

## Phase 5: Report & Learn

### Fix Report Format

```markdown
# Fix Report

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Issue**: [brief description]
**Severity**: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
**Category**: [from classification table]

## Problem
[Full error message or bug description]

## Root Cause
[5 Whys analysis result — the actual root cause]

## Fix Applied
| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| [path] | [what changed] | [why] |

## Agents Involved
| Agent | Task | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| [agent] | [what they did] | [result] |

## Verification
- [ ] Regression test added: [test file:test name]
- [ ] All tests pass: [X/Y passed]
- [ ] Build succeeds: Yes/No
- [ ] No new issues: Yes/No

## Prevention
[What should be done to prevent this class of bug in the future?]
- [ ] [Action item 1]
- [ ] [Action item 2]
```

### Report Filing

File the fix report at:
```
docs/reports/fix/YYYY-MM-DD-[issue-slug]-fix-report.md
```

Update `docs/INDEX.md` with the new report entry.
